# `kabaddiPy`


This documentation covers the main functions of the `KabaddiDataAPI` class that return useful data for Kabaddi statistics and information.

[`kabaddiPy`](https://github.com/kabaddiPy/kabaddiPy) is a python package that is designed to pull play-by-play, team, player and standings data from the newest version of the [ProKabaddi League](https://www.prokabaddi.com/) website. In the past, there have been a next to no scrapers for the Kabaddi.

With the first season of the league kicking off on January 1st, and games being broadcast on ESPN+, this package was created to allow access to play-by-play data to continue pushing womenâ€™s hockey analytics forward.

The lack of data and poor access to data have been the biggest barrier to entry in kabaddi analytics, a barrier that this package intends to alleviate.
