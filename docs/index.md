# Prokabaddi API

This documentation covers the main functions of the `KabaddiDataAPI` class that return useful data for Kabaddi statistics and information.


[`kabaddiPy`](https://github.com/kabaddiPy/kabaddiPy) is a python
Package that is designed to pull play-by-play data from
the newest version of the [ProKabaddi League](https://www.prokabaddi.com/). 
In the past, there have been a next to no scrapers for the Kabaddi.

With the first season of the league kicking off on January 1st, and
games being broadcast on ESPN+, this package was created to allow access
to play-by-play data to continue pushing womenâ€™s hockey analytics
forward.

The lack of data and poor access to data have been the
biggest barrier to entry in kabaddi analytics, a barrier that
this package intends to alleviate.
