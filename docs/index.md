With the first season of the league kicking off on January 1st, and games being broadcast on ESPN+, this package was created to allow access to play-by-play data to continue pushing womenâ€™s hockey analytics forward.

The lack of data and poor access to data have been the biggest barrier to entry in kabaddi analytics, a barrier that this package intends to alleviate.
