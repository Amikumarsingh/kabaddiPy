- Maintain the data in an open-source database. Updates when the API runs, after checking for differences. 

### 2. Integration of Machine Learning Models for Sports Analytics

- Implement in-built calls to scikit-learn predictive models to jump start basic analytics for data-driven decision making
- Provide predictive insights on player performance, match outcomes, and team strategies

### 3. Advanced Statistical Correlations

- Introduce functionality to analyze correlations between various game aspects, such as:
  
  - Relationship between the ***number of super raids*** and ***matches won***

  - Correlation between ***tackle points*** and ***overall defensive performance***
  - Relationship between **bonus points** and **total raid points**
  - Impact of ***all-out points*** on match outcomes
- 
- Provide insights to help teams optimize their strategies and player selections

### 4. Team and Player Profiling

- Develop comprehensive profiling tools for teams and individual players
- Analyze and visualize team-specific strengths, weaknesses, and playing styles
- Create player performance profiles based on various metrics (e.g., **raid success rate**, **tackle success rate**, **bonus point efficiency**)
- Enable comparison of player performances across different seasons


### 5. Historical Trend Visualization

- Develop interactive visualizations for historical team and player data
- Offer graphical representations of performance trends over time
- Include options for customizable date ranges and specific metrics
- Create violin plots to comprehensively visualize team behaviors and performances



We want to promote a more quantitative and analytical approach to complement traditional intuition-based strategies.
